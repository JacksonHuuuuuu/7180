                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Protect yourself from mosquitos, ticks and other insects, use insect repellent. It’s recommended to wear long-sleeved shirts and long 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp pants to avoid direct contact with insects, make sure you check for ticks daily, especially in unsuspecting areas of your body.

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Fires within your campground site should be at least 15 feet from tent walls, shrubs and trees, you can't leave the campfire unattended.
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp Always keep a water bucket nearby and put the fire out before leaving — making sure to drown all the embers, not just the red ones.
                    </p>
                    <ul><strong>&#9672 Watch Out For Wildlife</strong></ul>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Storing your food in a car, a bear-safe container or food storage locker can prevent attracting unwanted wildlife, do not feed them!
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp If you come into contact with wild animals, make sure you wash your hands with disinfectant water and check your body for parasite.

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Make sure you keep an eye on the weather, the lake is open and there is almost no place to avoid the bad weather. Make sure you have

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Swimming is an interesting activity to camp at the lakeside, but unknown underwater environments can bring dangers, such as deep
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp underwater depths and dangerous environmental organisms. Make sure to wear swimming equipment when swimmming.

                    <ul><strong>&#9672 Protect Your Skin From The Sun</strong></ul>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp We often think UV rays are absent on cloudy days, but they can burn your skin just as severely as on a sunny day. Midday hours are 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp when the sun’s rays are the strongest-seeking shade, wearing a hat or putting on sunglasses can help protect you from the UV rays. 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp So we recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen and lip screen with at least SPF 15.
                    </p>
                    <ul><strong>&#9672 Choose The Right Place To Set Up Your Tent</strong></ul>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp When camping at the seaside, it is very important to choose the right location. Do not set up the tent too close to the sea, the change 
                       <br>&nbsp&nbsp of tide may put you in danger.
                    </p>
                    <ul><strong>&#9672 Leave your tent closed</strong></ul>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp We always try and leave our tents shut when camping on the beach. Little grains of sand will blow past your tent all day. If you don’t 
                        <br> &nbsp&nbsp shut your tent up properly, expect to be sharing your bed with a fine layer of sand!

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Wearing your backpack wrong exerts more pressure on your neck, shoulders, and back. So make sure to adjust your shoulder straps
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp so that the backpack is high on your back and the straps are comfortable on your shoulders. A properly fitted backpack will keep you
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp moving comfortably, even with a heavy load.

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp The secret to staying healthy in high altitude areas, especially if you love to hike on your camping trips is to drink a lot of water to 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp stay hydrated and ensure your electrolytes remain balanced throughout. In this case, water and food that is high in potassium such 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp as bananas are highly recommended. These will help ward off headaches and the muscle cramps that plaque most mountain campers.

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp Even if you are a professional, I still highly recommend to camp at previously established campsites.
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp There is a reason the campsites were established there, and doing this ensures your safety as there will be other people with you, making  
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp the chance of things going wrong much lower. In addition, it is always good to know your surroundings and where things are located 
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp around you, however, remember, never do this exploring alone.
